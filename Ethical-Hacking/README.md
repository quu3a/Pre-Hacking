## Introduction

Ethical hacking, also known as penetration testing or white-hat hacking, involves legally breaking into computers and devices to test an organization's defenses. The purpose is to discover vulnerabilities and weaknesses in a system's security posture and fix them before malicious actors exploit them.

## Getting Started

- **Prerequisites**: Familiarity with computer systems, networks, and basic security concepts is recommended.
- **Setting up a Lab**: Create a safe and controlled environment for ethical hacking experiments using virtualization tools such as VirtualBox, VMware, or Docker.

## Core Concepts

- **Vulnerability Assessment**: Understanding vulnerabilities and weaknesses in systems, applications, and network infrastructure.
- **Penetration Testing**: Conducting authorized simulated attacks to identify security flaws and weaknesses.
- **Cybersecurity Best Practices**: Learning and implementing security measures to protect systems and data.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Network Scanning Tools**: Tools like Nmap, Nessus, and Wireshark for scanning and analyzing networks and systems.
- **Web Application Testing Tools**: Tools such as OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite, and Nikto for testing web applications for vulnerabilities.
- **Operating Systems for Ethical Hacking**: Familiarize yourself with Linux distributions like Kali Linux and Parrot Security OS.
- **Cryptography Tools**: Tools like OpenSSL and GnuPG for understanding and using cryptographic techniques.
