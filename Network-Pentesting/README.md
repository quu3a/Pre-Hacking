**Network penetration testing**

Network penetration testing (or network pentesting) is a cybersecurity assessment approach that involves simulating cyberattacks on a network infrastructure to identify security vulnerabilities and weaknesses. The primary goal of network penetration testing is to assess the security measures in place and help organizations improve their defenses against potential malicious activities.

**NMAP**

**What is Nmap ?? 


 - Nmap (Network Mapper) is an open source cross platform network scanning and security auditing utility that provides valuable information regarding hosts on a network.	

 - It is mainly used for; detecting live hosts on a network, detecting and testing firewalls and enumeration of services running on a host.



 *How does it work?

 - nmap works by sending specially crafted packets on a network to determine what hosts are active, what OS they are running, what services are running and whether a stateful firewall is present.

 - This information helps penetration testers to identify vulnerabilities and misconfigurations so that they can be patched or mitigated.


- Nmap Features -

		01.Network mapping & Host Discovery
Map networks and identify live hosts

		02.Port Scanning
Scan for open ports on a target

		03.OS Detection
Detect the OS version running on a target

		04.Service Version Detection
Detect the service version running on a particular port on a target

		05.Service Enumeration
Extract useful information from services using nmap scripts

		06.Firewall Detection & Evasion
Detect and evade firewalls through packet fragmentation, IP spoofing and decoys
