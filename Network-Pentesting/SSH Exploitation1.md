ENUMERATION

1. NMAP
# nmap -p 22 192.168.1.1 -sC

2. To retreive version
# nmap -p 22 192.168.1.1 -sV


3. To enumerate authentication methods using NMAP Scripts
- Check if server is accepting password based authentication 
# nmap --script ssh-auth-methods 192.168.1.1


Ssh version using msf
# use auxiliary/scanner/ssh/ssh_version
# set rhosts 192.168.1.1
# set rport 22
# exploit
