## Introduction

Networking forms the backbone of modern IT infrastructure, enabling communication and data transfer across various devices and systems. In the realm of cybersecurity, a solid understanding of networking principles is vital for effectively securing networks and mitigating potential threats.

## Core Networking Concepts

- **Protocol**: Understanding communication protocols is fundamental. Key protocols like TCP/IP, UDP, ICMP, etc., play critical roles in networking and security.
- **IP Addressing**: Familiarize yourself with IP addressing, subnetting, and the difference between IPv4 and IPv6.
- **Routing and Switching**: Learn about routers and switches, their functions, and how they impact network security.
- **OSI Model**: Gain insights into the OSI model and how it aids in understanding the flow of data through a network.

## Types of Networks

- **LAN (Local Area Network)**: Explore local networks and their security considerations.
- **WAN (Wide Area Network)**: Understand wide-area networks, their architecture, and associated security challenges.
- **Wireless Networks**: Learn about wireless networking, including Wi-Fi, and its security best practices.

## Network Security

- **Security Threats**: Familiarize yourself with various security threats such as malware, phishing, DoS attacks, and more.
- **Security Protocols**: Learn about security protocols like SSL/TLS, IPsec, SSH, and their role in securing network communication.
- **Firewalls and Intrusion Detection Systems**: Understand how firewalls and IDS/IPS systems contribute to network security.
