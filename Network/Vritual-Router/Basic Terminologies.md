*Basic Terminologies

- Need for pentesting
- Pentesting VS Bug hunting
- Pentesting methodologies
- Test cases
- Network protocols- TCP/UDP, Flags, 3 Way Handshake, Port Number
- Network infrastructure resources
- Lab setup- Virtualisation
- Networking in virtual box & vm ware workstation
- Virtual router setup
- Kali Linux installation

What is Protocol?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - In networking, a protocol is a set of rules for formatting and processing data.

 - Network protocols are like a common language for computers.

 - The computers within a network may use vastly different software and hardware; however, the use of protocols enables them to communicate with each other regardless.


Port number
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - port is an entry and exit point
 - every protocol uses a specific port to send and receive traffic.
 that port is assigned a number, which is called port number

 - Port Number 
    -  0 - 65535
    - 1 to 1024      --> server port
    - 1025 to 65535  --> client port



TCP | UDP
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - they are communication protocols which explain how two computers can communicate with each other.

- two computers can communicate with each other either through tcp or udp

TCP --> transmission control protocol --> connection oriented
UDP --> user datagram protocol        --> connection less




what is server?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - A server is a computer or system that provides resources, data, services, or programs to other computers, known as clients, over a network.

# How a server works

 - When a client requires data or functionality from a server, it sends a request over the network.

 - The server receives this request and responds with the appropriate information.

 - This is the request and response model of client-server networking, also known as the call and response model.

 - server is to provide resources functionality to clients

 - server is providing a services to a client



# Types of servers #

1.File servers
2.Print servers
3.Application servers
4.Web servers
5.Database servers
6.Virtual servers
7.Proxy servers
8.Monitoring and management servers


What is client and host?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Clients #

 - Clients are computer devices which access and uses the network as well as shares network resources.

 - They are also users of the network, as they can send and receive requests from the server.

# host #

 - A host is a computer, connected to other computers for which it provides data or services over a network.

 - every computer connected to a network acts as a host to other peers on the network.

 - In essence, a host reflects the logical relationship of two or more computers on a network.



What is Router?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Routers help you to connect with multiple networks. 

 - It enables you to share a single internet connection with multiple devices and saves money. 

 - This networking component acts as a dispatcher, which allows you to analyze data sent across a network.


What is Switch?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Switches work as a controller which connects computers, printers, and other hardware devices to a network in a campus or a building.

 - It allows devices on your network to communicate with each other, as well as with other networks. It helps you to share resources and reduce the costing of any organization.



						Network Penetration Testing


**What is Network Penetration Testing?


 - Network penetration testing is the ethical hacking of a network to discover how systems will respond to a real cybersecurity threat.

 - It is going to be only about network. we are going to look only about routers, we are going to look at firewalls, we are going to look at different services running on this devices. how to test them, how to check if it is vulnerable or not? we are going to deal with that.


					Benefits of Network Penetration Test
 
 - Pen testing can offer numerous benefits to any organization concerned about potential security vulnerabilities.

Some of the primary benefits of this type of security testing include:
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Identifying network security flaws
- Understanding risk levels
- Mapping out the organization's overall security posture


Why is network security important?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------
 - Establishing good network security is a process that requires ongoing effort and planning. Data breaches resulting from insecure or vulnerable networks are expensive, cause reputational damage, and create a loss of productivity during network downtime. Taking network security seriously is paramount to keeping any business running smoothly.


Who needs network penetration testing?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Any network connected to the internet should test its network security through vulnerability scanning and network penetration testing.



What are the primary goals during a network penetration test?
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

 - Identify application security/network flaws present in the environment.
 - Understand the level of risk for your organization.
 - Help address and fix identified application flaws.


Penetration testing types
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Internal penetration testing
  
# External penetration testing

 - Generally, it is the same process for internal and external network pen testing. Because of the nature of the work, the penetration testing tools may vary.
