Bug – Broken Link Hijacking

Scope – Facebook link in email confirmation mail.

Summary – The email confirmation sent by the application while registering is vulnerable to Broken Link Hijacking. The facebook link is broken and I’ve attached a detailed POC on it.

Steps To Reproduce :-
1.	Create a new account.
2.	The application will send an confirmation mail.
3.	The mail will have some social media icons.
4.	Click on facebook.
5.	You will be redirected to my hiveos page on facebook.

To check if the attack is successful the above steps should be performed and to impersonate how I did this complete attack :-
1.	Create a page with the same name as of the company’s link, so that the link should be same.
2.	When the link is not redirecting us to the desired location we can perform this kind of attack pretty easily.


Impact – Users can be tricked and can be exploited in certain cases.


Solution – If the facebook page is not necessary or is discontinued, remove the facebook button from the mail or if it’s necessary then create a fresh one.
