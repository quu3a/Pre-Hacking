*Vulnerable Change Password Page --medium level issue


- To check this first you need to create an account

- now we have successfully create the account, for some people

- i mean some people may not able to login into the application immediately after signup

- because they will be getting activation link

- so you need to check your email to activate the link to login, otherwise you cannot login

- now let's see whether we can login or not



- now the issue name is

# Vulnerable Change Password Page

- this means, it has to do something with change password page itself

- if you see the change password page is not asking for old password

- let's say if you have logged into a web application in the internet sharing center or cybercafe

- and if you forgot to logout, then an attacker can go to browser history and opens the page like this

- see, since you haven't logged out

- as soon attacker opens the website, he can see internal page

- and he goes to change password page and he changes your password

- this is one scenario, there are 2-3 other scenarios are there

# second scenario is 

- attacker will send you one link, as soon you click on that link your password will be changed

- now since this application is not asking  for old password on change password page

- remember guys, after login, inside the application(internal page)

- here it is showing as reset your password, this is a change password page actually

- because it's happening internally after logging in


## Vulnerable Change Password Page ##

# Description:

the application does not ask for the user to provide the current password when he is changing his password, it is asking only for "new password" and "confirm new password". 

# Impact:

this could allow the attackers to change the password of other users if the system left unattained by the victim.


# Recommendation:

It is recommended that current password should be verified at the server side before changing the password.
