*Weak Password Reset Implementation — Password Reset Token Sent Over HTTP


- So now as you got some idea about what it is, I hope you might have an idea of how this vulnerability works. Take some time to figure this out before you move on and see if you can guess is right.

## Steps to find this vulnerability :

- Go to the login page of the website.
- Click on the Password Reset button.
- You will get an email to your inbox to change the password.
- Like we did before don’t click on the link directly, rather copy its address.
- Open notepad or text editor and paste it and see if it starts with http://…
- If yes then we got a serious vulnerability.

- Since this is a password reset function and passwords are considered sensitive information of a user, they have to be dealt with in a more secure way. So if it is having http rather than https then its passage will be open and anyone who wishes to sniff your network can easily see it and even manipulate it to change it and take over your account.
