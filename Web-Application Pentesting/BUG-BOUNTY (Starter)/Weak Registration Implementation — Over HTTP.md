*Weak Registration Implementation — Over HTTP


# What is weak registration?
- Registration is a process to get yourself enrolled in something, like signing up for something. When it comes to websites, we always are concerned about privacy and integrity. So we choose the website that is more secure than the one which is not. Registration is a process that takes the information from the user stores it and uses it to authenticate the user next time he/she tries to log in. This information is personal and is not to be shared with anyone. So storing and changing this information should be secured in the best way possible.

- Now when we log in to a website the basic information we give over is our email and password. So these are the basic info and still strong enough info to be misused. Let us understand the scenario with an example

- Let there be a website named https://abc.com. By seeing the https we proceed to the website thinking it is safe, that is true to some extent. But we still need to check if it is using this https for all of their communications. If it fails to use this https for all of their communications then it can be exploited and is a vulnerability.

- Now we signup for this website abc.com, using email and a password. To really confirm that the email address is yours, the website sends you a confirmation email. You just need to click on the email and your email will be confirmed. But here comes the play. Some websites send this confirmation link over HTTP rather than HTTPS. So if someone is looking into your network and tries to steal your information they can easily do it as it is not a secure passway. Let us see how to find it.

## Steps to follow: ##

- Sign up for an account.
- You will get confirmation link.
- Go to your inbox and open the confirmation email.
- Don’t click on the button they provide to confirm.
- Rather copy the link of it by right-clicking the button and copying the - address of the button.
- Now open a notepad or any editor and paste the link.
- See if it is beginning with http://….
- If yes then it is not sending you the confirmation link over https, which - is not a safe passageway. This means your info can be captured or sniffed by a third person.

## This is something websites should look into. Even though it is not a serious vulnerability it still needs to be addressed.
