*Web Application Penetration Testing Methodology


- The methodology is nothing but a set of security industry guidelines on how the testing should be conducted. There are some well-established and famous methodologies and standards which can be used for testing, but since each web application demands different types of test to be performed, security analyst can create their own methodologies by referring the standards available in the market.

# Types of web applications 

- Static web application  
- Dynamic web application  


# Some of the security standards are 

- OWASP Open Web Application Security Project 
- SANS SysAdmin Audit Network Security 
- WASC Web Application Security Consortium


*Types of Web Penetration Testing


Web Applications can be tested internally or externally
-------------------------------------------------------

# Internal Penetration Testing #
As the name suggests, the internal pen testing is done within the organization over the LAN, hence it includes testing web applications hosted on the intranet. This helps in finding out if there could be vulnerabilities which exist within the corporate firewall.

# External Penetration Testing #
These are attacks done externally from outside the organization and include testing web applications hosted on the internet. Testers behave like hackers who arenâ€™t much aware of the internal system. To simulate such attacks, testers are given the IP of the target system and not provided any other information.


*Few Things you should now


# Website: #
it is a collection of publicly accessible, interlinked webpages that share a single domain name and published on at least one webserver.

# Webpage: #
A web page is document commonly written in hypertext mark-up language that is accessible through the internet. It can be identified by URL.

# Webserver: #
A webserver is a program which uses HTTP/HTTPS protocol to handle the requests and responses of the user (deals with static pages)

# Application Server: #
It runs all the processes your application requires by interacting with data base server and it can deal with multiple protocols (not restricted to HTTP and deals with dynamic pages)

# Data Base Server: #
It handles the data base queries

# Web browser: #
Web browsers are software applications that allow users to retrieve data and interact with content located on web pages within a website.
