**Reflected (Cross-site scripting)

- If your input reflect back then there may be Cross-site scripting.
- Checking for if input get's reflected in the page source, body, URL.
- If input get's reflected, we can hunt for RXSS.
- Sending a simple javascript to execute and prove XSS.
- If there is no input validation or sanitization then it is very. dangerous. there can be a vulnerability of xss.


**Stored (Cross-site scripting)

- If any application stores your input but into a unsafe manner.
- Always try where you can save the input xss payload where the server saves the payload.

# eg- 
edit profile, firstname, lastname, comment field, support chat bots, anywhere which is stored.
