Summary:

Discovered that the redvaultsecurity.com site exposed its Non-Cloudflare IP which could allow bypassing of anti-DDoS mechanisms.


Description:

Your origin servers are not blocking access from non-Cloudflare servers. This way crawlers can find your origin servers' IPs by checking random IPs until they found your origin server(s). What makes this especially easy are tools like censys.io (which can find your origin servers).

Steps To Reproduce:

1. https://search.censys.io/search?resource=hosts&sort=RELEVANCE&per_page=25&virtual_hosts=EXCLUDE&q=redvaultsecurity.com

2. https://search.censys.io/hosts/18.117.203.243?resource=hosts&sort=RELEVANCE&per_page=25&virtual_hosts=EXCLUDE&q=redvaultsecurity.com&at_time=2022-11-14T13%3A24%3A58.774Z

IPs:

Impact
This attack vector can be extremely bad because with the IP found out an attacker could attack the servers by DDoS or other attacks without being stopped by CloudFlare.
