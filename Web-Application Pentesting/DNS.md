DNS (Domain Name System) is a hierarchical and distributed naming system for translating human-readable domain names into IP addresses (and vice versa) that computers can use to communicate on a network. It's like the phonebook of the internet, helping computers find and communicate with each other using domain names, which are easier for humans to remember than numerical IP addresses.



This process occurs in the background every time you enter a domain name into your browser, allowing you to access websites using easy-to-remember domain names while the internet infrastructure communicates using IP addresses. DNS is essential for the functionality and usability of the internet.
Here's a simplified explanation of how DNS works:

1. **Domain Name Structure:**
   Domain names are structured hierarchically, with the top-level domain (TLD) at the highest level (e.g., .com, .org, .net), followed by second-level domains (e.g., google.com, example.org), and subdomains (e.g., www.google.com). Each domain is associated with an IP address.

2. **Domain Name Registration:**
   When a website owner wants to make their site accessible on the internet, they register a domain name through a domain registrar. The registrar records the domain information and associates it with the website owner's desired IP address.

3. **Domain Name Resolution:**
   When you enter a domain name (e.g., www.example.com) in your web browser, your computer needs to find the corresponding IP address to connect to the website. It starts by checking its local DNS cache to see if it already knows the IP address for that domain.

4. **Local DNS Cache:**
   If the IP address is not found in the local DNS cache, your computer queries a DNS resolver (typically provided by your internet service provider or another third-party service). The resolver maintains its cache of DNS records.

5. **Recursive DNS Query:**
   If the resolver doesn't have the IP address, it performs a recursive DNS query. It starts by querying the root DNS servers, which direct the query to the appropriate TLD DNS server based on the TLD of the domain (e.g., .com).

6. **TLD DNS Server:**
   The TLD DNS server directs the query to the authoritative DNS server for the second-level domain (e.g., example.com). This server stores information about the domain name, including the IP address associated with it.

7. **Authoritative DNS Server:**
   The authoritative DNS server provides the IP address associated with the domain name to the resolver.

8. **Response to Resolver:**
   The resolver receives the IP address from the authoritative DNS server and caches it for future use. It then responds to the original request made by the user's computer.

9. **Communication with the Website:**
   Now that the computer has the IP address associated with the domain name, it can establish a connection with the web server hosting the website using the obtained IP address.
